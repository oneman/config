In this paper we introduce novel algorithms and implement them on paper 
in-situ and in-silico, the code and data is availible under a free and
open source proprietary license when used for other purposes as intended.

In this scheme we aim to actualize the combinatorial best practices as
described by the center for network warfare physical cybersecurity study
group report "Algorithmic Cybernetworking: A NICE-2CU2 Implementation
Deployment via swiched decentralized chained checklist validation"

The remarkable illumination of the beast! Optically verified proof of stake!
